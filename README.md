This repo can be used to practice creating PRs.

# Summary
Knowing how to create PRs is important. 
**Tips:** 
1.  The **base fork** is where changes should be applied. The **head fork** contains the changes you would like to be applied.
2.  Be careful not to mix PRs commits.
3.  When creating the new branch, it is very important that you switch back to the **master** branch first. 
    If not, the new branch will be created off the current branch add-intro.
    And that is how you end up having commits of the first PR in the second PR as well.
